#Exercise 1: Add two strings together that, when concatenated, return your first and last name as your full name in one string.

#Concatenation

first_name = "Christin"
last_name = "Hebron"
puts first_name + " " + last_name

#Interpolation

first_name = "Christin"
last_name = "Hebron"
puts "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
